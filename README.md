# Quotes: A Swift Experiment

Quotes is a Mac Menu Bar App built with Swift
which uses the [Forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to present you
with inspiring quotes.  If you don't like reading you can even make your
computer read them to you!

This is just a personal project that enabled me to learn how to use Swift to
build menu bar apps and how to use the some parts of the Cocoa Framework.

## Requirements

- Xcode 7.3
- OSX 10.9+

## Instructions

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/JoaoFCosta/Quotes/releases) and run: `make install`
This moves the Quotes.app file to your /Applications folder.  👍
